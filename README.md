A Full-Stack Developer with a background as a professional theatre artist. I hold a diploma in Web Development, extensive experience in creative collaboration, teamwork and communication. A consumate learner, quick to adapt, I'm always looking to articulate better questions to deepen my knowledge of web and application development. I aspire to create fluid, clear, iterative, resiliant code that any teammate feels confident handling.
