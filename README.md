A Full-Stack Developer with a background as a professional artist. I hold a diploma in Web Development, extensive experience in creative collaboration, teamwork and communication. I love the creation process as a developer - watching each piece come to life and then fit together to make a whole. I aspire to build fluid, clear, intuitive code; the best apps or websites are the ones you don't remember. It's the story that sticks!
